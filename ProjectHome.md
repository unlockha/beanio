# BeanIO #
BeanIO is an open source Java framework for marshalling and unmarshalling Java objects from a flat file, stream, or simple String object.  BeanIO is configured using a XML mapping file, Java annotations or a builder API, and currently supports XML, CSV, delimited, and fixed length file formats.

For more information, including an online reference guide, please visit http://www.beanio.org.

Please note recent versions must be downloaded from Maven Central, since Google Code no longer accepts new downloads.  For Maven users, the following dependency can be used:

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.beanio</groupId>
  <artifactId>beanio</artifactId>
  <version>2.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

BeanIO source code hosting for future 3.x releases and higher has moved to github (see https://github.com/kevinseim/beanio).
